        // Taking three inputs
        double num1 = sc.nextDouble();
        double num2 = sc.nextDouble();
        double num3 = sc.nextDouble();

        // Comparing numbers
        if (num1 > num2 && num1 > num3) {
            System.out.println("Number1 is maximum with value of " + num1);
        } 
        else if (num2 > num1 && num2 > num3) {
            System.out.println("Number2 is maximum with value of " + num2);
        } 
        else {
            System.out.println("Number3 is maximum with value of " + num3);
        }
