Kumar wants to learn how the calculators are working.so he is trying to implements the calculator program.could you please help him to implements the program. - Notes:- Must use the Switch Case.operators - Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Modulo

Input Format

First input consists of integer.
Second input consists of integer.
third input consists of character.
Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format
